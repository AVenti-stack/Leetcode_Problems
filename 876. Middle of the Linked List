#using fast and slow pointers
Fast and slow pointers are mainly used for linked lists 

class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        slow, fast = head, head

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        return slow
