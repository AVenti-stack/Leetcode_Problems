Description
Given an array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence of elements that can be formed.

A consecutive sequence is a sequence of elements in which each element is exactly 1 greater than the previous element. The elements do not have to be consecutive in the original array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

#SORTING 
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        res = 0
        nums.sort()
        
        curr, streak = nums[0], 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(nums):
            if curr != nums[i]:
                curr = nums[i]
                streak = 0
            while i < len(nums) and nums[i] == curr:
                i += 1
            streak += 1
            curr += 1
            res = max(res, streak)
        return res


#HASHSET
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        numSet = set(nums)
        longest = 0

        for num in numSet:
            if (num - 1) not in numSet:
                length = 1
                while (num + length) in numSet:
                    length += 1
                longest = max(length, longest)
        return longest

#HASHMAP
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        mp = defaultdict(int)
        res = 0

        for num in nums:
            if not mp[num]:
                mp[num] = mp[num - 1] + mp[num + 1] + 1
                mp[num - mp[num - 1]] = mp[num]
                mp[num + mp[num + 1]] = mp[num]
                res = max(res, mp[num])
        return res
